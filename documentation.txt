rpopen.c
Client library implementing rpopen, takes as input host, port, and command.
If host or port is 0, sets the host and port to the environmental variables PPORT and PHOST.
Client sends the command to the host on the port indicated.
rpopen-demo.c
Default program to test the implementation of rpopen.c
change the port, host, command to other variables in order to test the client.
rpserver.c
Accepts the command from the client application and runs it after redirecting the output from the stdout into the socket to send back to the client.


Compile and Run:
type into command line after changing the directory to the correct folder
$ make
$ export PHOST=localhost
$ export PPORT=2000
this sets the environmental variables to host local and port 2000
as well as compiles the application
to run the demo program, first start the server
$ ./rpserver
then open another bash shell in the correct folder
$ ./rpopen-demo
this will run the application and return the server results to the client bash
** Note**
